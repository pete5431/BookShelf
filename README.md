# BookShelf

Book Shelf APP:

Part 1:
The app will display a list of book titles along with the author in a fragment. When clicked, the book and author will be displayed
on another fragment. If in portrait mode, a single fragment will be shown. In landscape or if using a tablet, both fragments will show.
